Remove Element
Given a linked list nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new linked list.
Do not allocate extra space for another linked list, you must do this by modifying the input linked list in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Input: 3 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3
Output: 2 -> 2
Input: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 -> 4 -> 2
Output: 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 0 -> 4
Iterate the linked list and jump the values that needs to be deleted (change the next pointer).
    Time Complexity:    O(N)
    Space Complexity:   O(1)
