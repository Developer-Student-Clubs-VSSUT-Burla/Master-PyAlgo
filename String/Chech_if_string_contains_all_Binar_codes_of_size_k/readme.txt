Given a binary string s and an integer k.

Return True if every binary code of length k is a substring of s. Otherwise, return False.



Example 1:

Input: s = "00110110", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The binary codes of length 2 are "00", "01", "10" and "11". They can be all found as substrings at indicies 0, 1, 3 and 2 respectively.
